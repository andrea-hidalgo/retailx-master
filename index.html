                            Kelly’s career has coincided with the trust economy: the rise of consumers’ demands for choice, immediacy, and access; the transformation of media; and the growth of social and environmental transparency. Her effective approach works on the principle that people – employees, customers, shareholders, or communities – want to feel good about their relationships with an organization. Kelly has a keen ability to build and share a clear vision, engage regulators and stakeholders, launch new products and services, build employee and customer trust, and navigate issues and crises – while understanding the realities of operations, regulation, and financial management.

                            Her work has touched nearly every point on the global supply chain, from component OEMs to global consumer retail at Best Buy. She’s curated and shared great stories of how the products we consume are sourced, made, delivered to market, disposed of, and recycled – with results that go well beyond awareness or foot traffic, and even help to convert risk and issues (such as electronics recycling) into reputation and revenue drivers.

                        When you're wandering at night, your Lightpad softly glows so there's no fumbling to find a switch. You can even customize the glow color to match your home and preference. Shut off power to your current light switch, and remove it by unscrewing the plate and disconnecting the rear wires. Attach your new Lightpad by connecting the corresponding wires and screwing the unit into place.
